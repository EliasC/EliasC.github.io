Research
========

I am a PhD student at [Uppsala University](http://www.it.uu.se){:target="blank"}.
My advisor is [Tobias Wrigstad](http://www.wrigstad.com){:target="blank"} and my
co-advisor is [Dave Clarke](http://supercooldave.github.io/){:target="blank"}. I do
research on programming languages, in particular type systems for
controlling aliasing and preventing data-races in concurrent and
parallel programs.

I am one of the main contributors
to [Encore](https://encore-lang.github.io/){:target="blank"}, a
highly concurrent object-oriented programming language. Encore's
type system guarantees the absence of data-races and is based on
my work on Kappa [](TODO: Page of its own).

Teaching
========

I am the main teaching assistant for a second year 20 ECTS credits
course called Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming
Methodology, given by Tobias Wrigstad. In 2017, Tobias was voted
teacher of the year by the CS and IT students! [](TODO: Add more info)

During 2016 and 2017 I shared the lectures of another 20 ECTS
credits course called Program Design and Data Structures.

During my undergraduate studies I worked as a TA and certified
Supplemental Instructions mentor for several courses on functional
programming and algorithms.


Students
--------

I am currently supervising the following master thesis projects:

* Gustav Lundin -- Array Capabilities for Encore

I have supervised the following bachelor thesis projects:

* Gustav Lundin -- [Pattern Matching in Encore](http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:uu:diva-294513){:target="blank"}
* Christian Törnqvist -- [Finding Patterns in Lock-Free Algorithms](http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1136791)
* Joel Wallin -- Implementing Safe Sharing Features in Encore (link forthcoming)
* Jonas Olander -- Separate Compiling for Encore (link forthcoming)


Personal
========

I spend a lot of my free time on listening to and creating music.

* Since 2008 I am the conductor of
  [Kalmar Nation's Choir](http://kalmarnation.se/koren){:target="blank"}
  in Uppsala.
  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrlqO8PqJs){:target="blank"}
  is a video of us performing of Vienna Teng's beautiful Hymn of Acxiom.
* Since 2015 I am a singer in
  [Uppsala Vokalensemble](http://uppsalavokalensemble.se/){:target="blank"}.
* I also like to write and arrange choir music.
  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2gzhjwBczI){:target="blank"}
  is a recording of my setting of Alfred Tennyson's Now Sleeps
  the Crimson Petal, performed by the women's choir
  [Discordia](http://udkdiscordia.se/){:target="blank"}.
  [](TODO: Another page)
* I play the electric and upright
  bass. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPzk-28ZiYc) is a
  recording I made as a Christmas present for the friend who
  introduced me to the wonderful music of [Vulfpeck](http://vulfpeck.com/){:target="blank"}.
* I play bass in the now dormant band Morfis. Our album
  [Dunia](https://open.spotify.com/album/0Sn5iIamcssFcc6EdZvnzi){:target="blank"}
  from 2013 is on Spotify! I wrote and arranged the songs Gånglåt
  från Gottsunda ("Walking Song from Gottsunda"), Cykeltjuven
  ("The Bicycle Thief") and Kometen ("The comet").
