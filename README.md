Research
========

I am a post-doc researcher in [David
Broman](https://www.kth.se/profile/dbro){:target="blank"}'s
[group](https://www.kth.se/scs/mcs){:target="blank"} at
[KTH](http://www.kth.se){:target="blank"}, working on
heterogeneous model compilers and semantics. I am currently
involved in two projects; one relating to [composition of language
semantics](https://people.kth.se/~dbro/hmc.html), and one relating
to [full-stack verification of programs synthesized from timed
automata](https://people.kth.se/~dbro/projects.html).

I did my PhD with [Tobias
Wrigstad](http://www.wrigstad.com){:target="blank"} and [Dave
Clarke](http://supercooldave.github.io/){:target="blank"} at
[Uppsala University](http://www.it.uu.se){:target="blank"}. There,
I did research on programming languages, in particular type
systems for controlling aliasing and preventing data-races in
concurrent and parallel programs.

From April to July in 2018, I did an internship at Microsoft
Research in Cambridge, working together with [Matthew
Parkinson](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/mattpark/){:target="blank"}
and [David
Chisnall](https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~dc552/){:target="blank"} on
compiler-based mitigation of the
[Spectre](https://meltdownattack.com/) attacks.

I am one of the main contributors
to [Encore](https://encore-lang.github.io/){:target="blank"}, a
highly concurrent object-oriented programming language. Encore's
type system guarantees the absence of data-races and is based on
my work on Kappa [](TODO: Page of its own).

Teaching
========

I was the main teaching assistant for a second year 20 ECTS credits
course called Imperative and Object-Oriented Programming
Methodology, given by Tobias Wrigstad. In 2017, Tobias was voted
teacher of the year by the CS and IT students! [](TODO: Add more info)

During 2016 and 2017 I shared the lectures of another 20 ECTS
credits course called Program Design and Data Structures.

During my undergraduate studies I worked as a TA and certified
Supplemental Instructions mentor for several courses on functional
programming and algorithms.


Students
--------

I am currently supervising the following master thesis projects:

* Alfrida Mattisson -- Automatically Choosing Implementations of Abstract Data Types

I have supervised the following bachelor thesis projects:

Personal
========

I spend a lot of my free time on listening to and creating music.

* From 2008 to 2017 I was the conductor of
  [Kalmar Nation's Choir](http://kalmarnation.se/koren){:target="blank"}
  in Uppsala.
  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgrlqO8PqJs){:target="blank"}
  is a video of us performing of Vienna Teng's beautiful Hymn of Acxiom.
* Since 2015 I am a singer in
  [Uppsala Vokalensemble](http://uppsalavokalensemble.se/){:target="blank"}.
* I also like to write and arrange choir music.
  [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l2gzhjwBczI){:target="blank"}
  is a recording of my setting of Alfred Tennyson's Now Sleeps
  the Crimson Petal, performed by the women's choir
  [Discordia](http://udkdiscordia.se/){:target="blank"}.
  [](TODO: Another page)
* I play the electric and upright
  bass. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPzk-28ZiYc) is a
  recording I made as a Christmas present for the friend who
  introduced me to the wonderful music of [Vulfpeck](http://vulfpeck.com/){:target="blank"}.
* I play bass in the now dormant band Morfis. Our album
  [Dunia](https://open.spotify.com/album/0Sn5iIamcssFcc6EdZvnzi){:target="blank"}
  from 2013 is on Spotify! I wrote and arranged the songs GÃ¥nglÃ¥t
  frÃ¥n Gottsunda ("Walking Song from Gottsunda"), Cykeltjuven
  ("The Bicycle Thief") and Kometen ("The comet").
